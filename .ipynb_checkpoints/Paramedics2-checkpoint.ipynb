        "1. *Improved Out-of-Hours and Overnight Services*: Needs for more services outside normal GP hours, including out-of-hours GPs, district nurses, and extended hours for services like OPAL or SDEC.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. *More Specialised Services and Direct Acess*: Suggestions include direct access to services like SDEC, SAU, MAU, ENT, urology, and pediatric advice for under 1s, without the need to go through EDs. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. *Streamlined Referral Processes and Single Point of Contact*: Having a single point of access for various services like OPAL, community, 111, & mental health or a simplified referral process to reduce confusion and enhance efficiency. \n",
        "\n",
        "4. *Mental Health Services*: Emphasizes the need for enhanced mental health services, including 24/7 mental health triage and direct access to mental health support without intermediary services. \n",

        "6. *Community and Home-Based Care*: Suggestions for more community-based services, night-sitting, increased capacity in community hospitals, and more in-home care options to reduce ED admissions. \n",
        "\n",
        "7. *Digital and Updated Directories of Services*: The need for a digital, constantly updated directory of services, possibly with a system that suggests the best service options based on input criteria.\n",

        "12. *Enhanced Support for Specific Conditions*: This includes pathways for conditions like TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack), chest pain clinics, early pregnancy issues, and catheter problems.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "14. *Improving Pre-Hospital Care and Discharge Processes*: The response questions why patients can't be treated and discharged directly from an ambulance when appropriate and calls for more support for patients with social issues who are medically fit but cannot be left at home.\n",
