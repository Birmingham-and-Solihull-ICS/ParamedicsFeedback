1. The responses were categorized into several common themes for a high-level analysis of feedback from paramedic crews and to facilitate visualization. Details of the categorization process are available in the data tab.
2. The most frequently used words were identified by splitting the responses into root words, following the removal of stop words, punctuation, and noise, and applying lemmatization using natural language processing techniques. Care must be taken when analyzing the frequency of words to consider the context in which they appear. Therefore, this word frequency analysis should be viewed in conjunction with the common themes identified in the respondents' answers.
